## Computer History && Trivia Quiz

I wrote twenty multiple-choice questions covering computer science, history and trivia topics that I found interesting or amusing. I learned just as much researching the questions as I did coding the game. At the end of the quiz there are links to a few documentaries and other resources that I enjoyed while working on this project.
